Hello LinkedIn network:-)

So I was thinking of whipping up something really clever where I would create segments in my contact list, then create custom messages per segment, then integrate with a mailer tool to manage a nurture sequence...

Then I thought, "don't be daft" just write a post.

So yeah, here's a post. I'll be coming free in the next few weeks and will once again be pounding the pavement in search of interesting roles:-)

So, if you have a Dug-shaped gap in your project, please do let me know.

<That is all>

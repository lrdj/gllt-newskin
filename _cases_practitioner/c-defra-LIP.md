title: "Structuring complex transformation initiatives for effective delivery at Defra"
# title: "Defra Livestock Information Programme"

subtitle: >
  When the Livestock Information Programme stalled after two years, I led the effort to bring clarity, governance, and structure to the transformation. By establishing a clear service design framework, I ensured alignment across technology, policy, and user needs—allowing the program to accurately estimate effort, scope, and cost for phased delivery.

# subtitle: >
#  The Livestock Information programme (LIP) had been running 
# for a little over two years when I joined the team to lead 
# the design of the service. Lots of work had been done, but 
# nothing had been delivered yet, and passing Beta assessment 
# did not seem like a possibility.

### The challenge

Navigating through a scenario where talented professionals were siloed in their expertise and lacked a coherent, uniting framework and strategy, especially amidst the divergent work-streams of IT, data, policy, and design. The notable absence of an organized process to morph insights into actionable initiatives further complicated the journey from research to delivery.

### The role I played

As the Service Design Lead, I became the connective tissue that unified diverse professional minds, acting as a strategic advisor, influencer, mentor, and hands-on guide across all facets of the design and development process.

### How I did it

I employed a multifaceted approach, intertwining strategic leadership with hands-on mentoring and knowledge transfer.

By implementing a clear, communicated strategy through a ‘tube map’ and guiding through a methodical ‘double-diamond’ design process, I ensured the journey from divergent ideas to converged, actionable prototypes and MVP was coherent and strategic.

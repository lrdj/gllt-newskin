  <h2>Thoughts from Dug about developing the Carwow proposition and joining Sally's team...</h2>

</section>


<section>

<h1>Why does Carwow have customers?</h1>

<p>
  For both of these value propositions we assume the customer is: Individuals in the UK looking to sell their car quickly. Who they are: Private car owners, often with vehicles that are difficult to sell privately or via trade-ins. They may value speed, simplicity, and convenience over securing the highest price.</p>

<h2>Value proposition: Carwow</h2>

<div class="valpropBlock">
  <img src="/valtech/i/prop-carwow.png" class="vprop">
<div>

<p>
Carwow addresses the frustrations of traditional car buying by simplifying the process, providing transparency, and ensuring a user-centric experience. It’s particularly appealing to tech-savvy buyers who value convenience and cost savings.</p>

<h2>Value proposition: Webuyanycar</h2>

<img src="/valtech/i/prop-wbac.png" class="vprop">

<p>
  WeBuyAnyCar appears to align well with its customer segment by addressing the specific pains (hassle, risk, and time) and delivering gains (speed, simplicity, security). The company has positioned itself as the go-to solution for quick, stress-free car sales in the UK.

<h2>What it means (who might be Carwow's biggest competitor?)</h2>

<p>
Based on these unvalidated and guessed ratings, Motorway could be Carwow's biggest competitor.</p> 

<h3>Strengths shared by Carwow and Motorway?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparency in pricing:</strong><br>Both platforms allow dealers to bid on cars, creating competition and higher transparency for sellers.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive offers:</strong><br>The auction-style model enables sellers to secure higher prices compared to fixed-price services like WeBuyAnyCar (maybe... is this true?).</li>
  <li><strong>Simple process:</strong><br>Both have streamlined online systems that minimise hassle for sellers.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on dealer networks:</strong><br>Both connect sellers directly with dealers, bypassing the need for branches or private buyers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motorway's edge over Carwow?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty about car valuation:</strong><br>Motorway's valuation process is highly transparent, and sellers often get bids that reflect the market value, making it slightly stronger in this area.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden fees:</strong><br>Motorway consistently emphasises a fee-free experience for sellers, which can be a deciding factor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Carwow's Differentiators?</h3>

<p>
Carwow is a broader platform that also supports buyers (especially for new cars), meaning it benefits from brand recognition among a dual audience.</p>

<h3>Head-to-head comparison:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Motorway is better suited for sellers prioritizing price maximization.</li>
  <li>Carwow has an edge with its cross-functional platform for both buying and selling.</li>
</uk>

<p>
However, for pure car-selling services, Motorway is the closest and strongest competitor to Carwow.</p>

<p style="font-size: larger;font-weight: bold;">
But this is entirely make-beleive and just the result of a half-hour look online. To manage this proposition will require ongoing research, planning, and creative.</p>

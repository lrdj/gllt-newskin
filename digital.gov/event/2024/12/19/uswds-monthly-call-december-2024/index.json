Today the USWDS logo is in a classic wreath form for the holiday season, with evergreen panels and a bright poinsettia-red segment like a bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 2.\u003c/strong\u003e My name is Dan Williams, he/him, and I\u0026rsquo;m the USWDS project lead — and here on-screen is my avatar: dark hair, blue sweater, collared shirt, glasses — today I\u0026rsquo;m wearing a red checked collared shirt and a blue workshirt. And bright green socks, for luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kate mentioned, we are recording this call, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say we\u0026rsquo;re able to share the recordings of these monthly calls publicly. You can find pretty much everything back to January 2023 on our website, at \u003ca href=\"http://designsystem.digital.gov/about/monthly-calls\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edesignsystem.digital.gov/about/monthly-calls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. We typically post videos shortly after the monthly call and we also link out to the slides and the script, hosted at Digital.gov. We\u0026rsquo;ve posted a link to our monthly calls page in the chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ll be posting other links and references into the chat as we go along. And today we\u0026rsquo;re continuing something we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the last couple calls when it comes to chats and questions. Today, in your Zoom window you\u0026rsquo;ll find a Q\u0026amp;A button in addition to a chat button, possibly under a \u0026ldquo;More\u0026rdquo; button. We\u0026rsquo;d like to encourage folks to ask questions in the Q\u0026amp;A section instead of the chat. Take a sec now to find the Q\u0026amp;A section and open it up. If any member of our team can answer your question in the Q\u0026amp;A section, we\u0026rsquo;ll do so. Otherwise, there\u0026rsquo;ll be some time for questions and answers at the end of the hour. But the chat\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e nice too! Let\u0026rsquo;s use the chat for introducing ourselves, or for any other comments or discussion. Be sure to introduce yourself in the chat — it\u0026rsquo;s nice to know who\u0026rsquo;s here. It\u0026rsquo;s good to have you here today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those of you who find the chat distracting, you’re welcome to close or hide those discussions during the main presentation. You can reopen them later during the Q\u0026amp;A session at the end of this call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one final note that starting with this call, we\u0026rsquo;re going to try to end a couple minutes before the top of the hour to give folks at least a moment before they move on to the next thing in their day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo thanks! And, with that, let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 3.\u003c/strong\u003e So what\u0026rsquo;s our agenda for today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, first we\u0026rsquo;ll check out a handful of product updates. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll hear from the Federal Website Standards team about the new website standards, followed by a discussion about the relationship between the standards and the design system which should also leave time for your questions at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 4.\u003c/strong\u003e Let’s kick it off with a number of product updates!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 5.\u003c/strong\u003e First, USWDS 3.11.0, our December USWDS release, out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 6.\u003c/strong\u003e This is a nice little release and it has a couple of notable updates and improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst, \u003cstrong\u003ewe added more consistent styling for table headers.\u003c/strong\u003e Now table headers will get consistent styling no matter where they appear in a table, not just in column headers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe also made a couple updates based on community contributions. \u003cstrong\u003eWe fixed the display of focus outlines in the identifier.\u003c/strong\u003e Now, focus outlines don’t get clipped when they appear in some locations in the identifier\u0026rsquo;s list of required links.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd finally, \u003cstrong\u003ewe added a more modern CSS reset\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0026rsquo;re left some of the older IE11-constrained reset techniques behind and moved to a slimmer reset.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/releases/tag/v3.11.0\"\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s USWDS 3.11.0\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 7.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0026rsquo;ve also released a good quality-of-life update to USWDS Compile, in USWDS Compile 1.2.1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn its next major release, Sass is changing how it handles mixed declaration style definitions to match new CSS patterns. Because of this, users are getting alarming warnings during compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pattern is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e currently deprecated, and we are on track to update the related USWDS code. But these current warnings are alarming and noisy — they can distract folks from the release-related notifications we hope devs \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e notice from release to release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in USWDS Compile 1.2.1 we\u0026rsquo;re introducing a new setting, enabled by default, that silences these warnings that originate in the USWDS codebase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach will mute USWDS warnings, including any future warnings that come up, while allowing warnings from custom Sass to still be triggered in the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will allow Sass to notify users of impending deprecations in their custom code without the noise of hearing about what\u0026rsquo;s happening in USWDS. And, of course, users can decide to manually turn on these deprecation warnings back on with a single setting if they would like additional context on the upcoming deprecations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s USWDS Compile 1.2.1: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds-compile/releases/tag/v1.2.1\"\u003eout now!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 8.\u003c/strong\u003e December is a big month for accessibility test pages. We\u0026rsquo;ve got five new pages out now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/process-list/accessibility-tests/\"\u003eProcess list\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/summary-box/accessibility-tests/\"\u003eSummary box\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/collection/accessibility-tests/\"\u003eCollection\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/icon-list/accessibility-tests/\"\u003eIcon list\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e…and \u003ca href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button-group/accessibility-tests/\"\u003eButton group\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that wraps 2024 for accessibility test pages! We\u0026rsquo;ve published 34 pages this year and just have 11 more prepped for publication in the coming months. This has been a great accomplishment for our accessibility team, and for the team effort with content and engineering to consistently publish these pages from month to month!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext in the queue are Date picker, Date range picker, Alert, and Site alert, coming in January.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 9.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0026rsquo;ve also released an updated version of the USWDS beta design kit for Figma. This new version tidies up the layers and directories in our components, better conforming to naming best practices and also making it a bit more straightforward to select layers. We\u0026rsquo;ve posted \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1440921849343185329/uswds-design-kit-beta\"\u003ea link to the USWDS design kit for Figma\u003c/a\u003e in the chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 10.\u003c/strong\u003e There are three public discussions to highlight this month:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe first is an active discussion about \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/5798\"\u003eproviding support for user preferences\u003c/a\u003e. The original discussion topic raises a few user browser preferences: \u003cstrong\u003eprefers-color-scheme\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eprefers-contrast\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eprefers-reduced-motion\u003c/strong\u003e. USWDS has done a lot of work over the last year in supporting high contrast and forced color mode, though this is through the mechanism of the \u003cstrong\u003eforced-colors\u003c/strong\u003e media query and not via \u003cstrong\u003eprefers-contrast\u003c/strong\u003e. We also prefer solutions with reduced motion, so we haven\u0026rsquo;t spent much time investigating reduced motion solutions, but \u003cstrong\u003eprefers-color-scheme\u003c/strong\u003e is a media query–speak for supporting Dark Mode, and that\u0026rsquo;s a place where we could use some more opinions. If you want to support dark mode, or have tried to implement support for a dark mode scheme inside of USWDS or not, we\u0026rsquo;d be interested in hearing from you in this discussion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBeyond dark mode, we\u0026rsquo;d also like to direct folks to this month\u0026rsquo;s Accessibility discussion: on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/6243\"\u003eHTML titles and accessibility\u003c/a\u003e. Providing good HTML titles is also one of the new draft federal website standards, which we\u0026rsquo;ll hear more about later in this call, so I think folks would benefit from more discussion about what\u0026rsquo;s working when it comes to the accessibility and usability of titles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd finally, we\u0026rsquo;ve posted a public version of last month\u0026rsquo;s monthly call Q\u0026amp;A in discussions as well. You can check that out via \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/6252\"\u003ethe link in the chat\u003c/a\u003e if you missed last month\u0026rsquo;s call.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 11.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0026rsquo;re also moving ahead in the world of pattern and component proposals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re happy to announce that at long last, we\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/5765#discussioncomment-11487203\"\u003edecided to move ahead with the Tabs component proposal\u003c/a\u003e. We’ll publish the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/5765#discussioncomment-11487203\"\u003eapproved formal proposal\u003c/a\u003e once we’ve finalized it. \u003cem\u003eWe’ll\u003c/em\u003e be taking on experimental development for that component, and will use the Tabs component to work out engineering, accessibility, usability, and documentation \u003cem\u003erequirements\u003c/em\u003e for experimental components. More to come on Tabs as we move into 2025 and toward the release of USWDS Elements and USWDS Core in the spring.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve also decided to move forward with a pattern proposal for \u003cstrong\u003eHelping users to know when their information is prefilled\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0026rsquo;ll be drafting a formal proposal for community comment shortly, including how exactly we should add this to the USWDS pattern library, working with the team from the VA who proposed it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd we\u0026rsquo;re deciding \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to proceed with a proposal for a Toast component. Our accessibility and usability review of this component revealed consistent accessibility issues with implementations of Toast that make this component less of a good match for USWDS applications. You can find our research and reasoning in the Toast \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/5770#discussioncomment-11419226\"\u003ediscussion\u003c/a\u003e — we\u0026rsquo;re posting that link in the chat.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 12.\u003c/strong\u003e And our last product update is on our development work for USWDS Elements, the new Web Components flavor of the design system we\u0026rsquo;ll start to roll out in the spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve taken some time over the last month to test out interoperability between our \u003cem\u003eElements\u003c/em\u003e (composed using a light layer of the Lit library) and both the other big Web Components library — StencilJS — and React 19. And while there may still be some need for a custom React wrapper in versions older than 19, we\u0026rsquo;re happy to report that we\u0026rsquo;re finding successful practical interop with both Stencil and React 19. More to come on this in the coming months, but delivering components that pass attributes and properties seamlessly between differing development frameworks — in addition to reliable event handling and predictable lifecycle methods — is one of our goals with USWDS Elements, so teams can use these components all kinds of existing tech stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it for this month\u0026rsquo;s product updates!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 13.\u003c/strong\u003e As I\u0026rsquo;m sure many of the folks on this call are aware, there\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a change over the last few months when it comes to the website standards referenced in the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (or 21st Century IDEA). Starting in January 2020, the USWDS website held the canonical version of the website standards referenced in 21st Century IDEA. This first set of standards directed teams to use the USWDS maturity model to deliver a great digital experience. Starting in September, USWDS no longer maintains this standard, and, going forward, a new Federal Website Standards team is responsible for a new set of standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there have been a lot of changes in the world of federal website standards, and this month we wanted to talk with the Federal Website Standards team to hear about what\u0026rsquo;s changed in the standards, and how that team is approaching the work of developing standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also wanted to leave some space for a discussion about how USWDS and the Federal Website Standards relate, how they\u0026rsquo;re different, and how they work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 14.\u003c/strong\u003e So to that end, let me introduce Renata Phillippi (she/her). Renata is the Acting Program Manager for the Federal Website Standards. Renata, take it away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 15.\u003c/strong\u003e Renata: Thank you, Dan, for the introduction. My name is Renata Phillippi. I am a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow who has been working on building website standards to help agencies provide high-quality, consistent digital experiences for anyone. I am a white woman with shoulder length dark blonde hair.

It requires all agencies to modernize their public-facing websites and digital services, digitize services and forms, accelerate use of e-signatures, improve customer experience and standardize and transition to centralized shared services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 25.\u003c/strong\u003e It meant that digital services should be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAccessible to people of diverse abilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave consistent visual design and agency brand identity\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContent that is authoritative and easy to understand\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInformation and services that are discoverable and optimized for search\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecure by design, secure by default\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser-centered and data-driven design\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustomized and dynamic user experiences\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMobile-first design that scales across a variety of device sizes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough our user research, we heard from agency practitioners that they were not sure exactly what this meant for them. When 21st Century IDEA was passed, digital teams government-wide worked to meet the spirit of the law and improve the public’s experience on government websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 26.\u003c/strong\u003e Fast forward to 2023, agencies still needed more concrete guidance on how to implement the law. On the slide, we are showing 21st Century IDEA moving to the new policy guidance in the OMB memo M-23-22 (Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience). The memo contains over one hundred actions, including a small set of timed actions. The one we are talking about today is updating the website standards. M-23-22 says “GSA, in coordination with OMB and relevant interagency bodies and stakeholders, will review and update, as necessary, the existing Federal website standards to align with this guidance. These updates will include guidelines for branding, content, and search.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 27.\u003c/strong\u003e We worked with OMB to develop a pilot to learn about what we could do to standardize the digital experience. Let’s talk about that pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 28.\u003c/strong\u003e Our goal was to propose an initial set of evidence-based, auditable standards that will help agencies meet the public’s expectations for digital experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 29.\u003c/strong\u003e Stakeholders from OMB and TTS started with a list of 30 potential standards that came from user research and used the RICE framework to score them. RICE stands for reach, impact, confidence, and effort. Or said another way, how much reach and impact will this feature have, how confident are we that we can deliver, and how much effort will it take to do so. We got the list down to 8 that we started with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached out to the members of the CIO Council’s Digital Experience Council, which is a group of agency leaders who are all focused on improving the digital experience of their agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe partnered with the VA, USAID, SSA, State, Air Force, CMS, DHS, and internal partner, Cloud.gov Pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did user research with the public and with agencies and desk research about industry best practices. We built prototypes, tested the content, got feedback and iterated. Then we launched with 3 new standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 30.\u003c/strong\u003e Let’s talk about the standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 31.\u003c/strong\u003e We defined standards as actions that will help agencies meet the public’s evolving expectations for digital experiences. The standards are evidence-based, auditable and lead to a consistent digital experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 32.\u003c/strong\u003e We launched our website (\u003ca href=\"http://standards.digital.gov\"\u003estandards.digital.gov\u003c/a\u003e) with three pending standards that will be tracked for compliance at some point in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government banner which has the line “this is a federal government website”, with the flag, and the \u0026ldquo;this is how you know\u0026rdquo; dropdown, which is an item we found the public looks for to know if they can trust the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also pending standards for HTML page title and meta page description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 33.\u003c/strong\u003e Standards that are currently in draft status and will become pending standards after a period of review are the contact page, content timeliness indicator, and site search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 34.\u003c/strong\u003e And we have two that are currently in research and continuing to be explored. That’s the external link. (We’ve had questions about what an external link is? Does it link outside of the government or outside of your website but to another government page? Just a couple of questions we are exploring.) And then the language selector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ll find on every standard page on our website we have listed the why, where it applies, the acceptance criteria, and how to implement the standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlide 35.\u003c/strong\u003e If you have any questions or want to see more, you can go to our website (standards.digital.gov), check out our GitHub discussions (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/discussions\"\u003ehttps://github.com/GSA-TTS/federal-website-standards/discussions\u003c/a\u003e) or email (\u003ca href=\"mailto:website.standards@gsa.gov\"\u003ewebsite.standards@gsa.gov\u003c/a\u003e).

By 2021, the site had accumulated more than 200,000 pages of content. This made it difficult for users to find the information they needed and could understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we launched an effort to modernize our digital communications. This included improving the user experience on CDC.gov by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreamlining content\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnhancing navigation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRefreshing the look and feel of the website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImplementing a new content management system\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the CDC’s Office of Communications, we led change across the agency and the improvement of the site itself: CDC.gov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-approach-project-clean-slate\"\u003eThe approach: Project Clean Slate\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur approach to this challenge centered on an effort we named “Project Clean Slate.” Clean Slate was a bold idea to take down CDC.gov and relaunch it with fresh content. This content would be intentionally written with clear communication goals and audience needs in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy this approach? We chose this path because of our commitment to bolstering public health and \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/trust/\"\u003etrust\u003c/a\u003e in government resources. And with the increased enthusiasm for delivering those values through digital content, we had the capacity to be thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the broader \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/\"\u003edigital communication modernization effort\u003c/a\u003e within the federal government, and as part of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc-moving-forward.html\"\u003eCDC Moving Forward initiative\u003c/a\u003e, we initiated Project Clean Slate to restart CDC.gov with a leaner website and consistent, well-structured content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-strategies-from-the-clean-slate-approach\"\u003eKey strategies from the Clean Slate approach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur project had an aggressive timeline with high expectations — and support — from senior leadership. Our Clean Slate approach was important in helping us kickstart the project and maintain momentum. We learned other lessons throughout the project that were integral to our success. We used \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/product-and-project-management/\"\u003eproject management\u003c/a\u003e best practices to ensure our success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what approach you take to content \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/governance/\"\u003egovernance\u003c/a\u003e, these concepts will apply and serve you well:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSet clear goals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCollaborate with all teams\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIterate and test continuously\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContinuously monitor site performance\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few additional approaches that we implemented during the Clean Slate process that were unique, specific, and particularly useful if your team has the support and capacity to implement this strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lesson-1-use-beta-sites-to-test-your-designs\"\u003eLesson 1. Use beta sites to test your designs.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCDC gathered feedback from more than 6,000 users over the last two years. We were committed to using \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/human-centered-design/\"\u003ehuman-centered design\u003c/a\u003e principles throughout the redesign process. We kept in touch with users early on to understand their needs and experiences. We kept this line of communication at every stage through user testing and feedback collection to ensure that user needs were met effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early 2024, we hosted a beta preview of the new CDC.gov. We received input from more than 3,000 people during testing and survey feedback before launching the new site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u003carticle\n  class=\"dg-note dg-note--action\"\n\u003e\n  \u003ch4 class=\"dg-note__heading\"\u003e\n    \u003csvg\n      class=\"dg-note__icon usa-icon dg-icon dg-icon--large\"\n      aria-hidden=\"true\"\n      focusable=\"false\"\n    \u003e\n      \u003cuse xlink:href=\"/uswds/img/sprite.svg#campaign\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\n    \u003c/svg\u003e\n    \n      \n        Action\n      \n    \n  \u003c/h4\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvice for small teams\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your team does not have the support to launch a beta site, there are other ways to conduct thorough \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/research/\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/cx/resources/guides-kits/dhs-usability-testing-kit\"\u003euser testing\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-customer-experience/\"\u003ecollect feedback\u003c/a\u003e to inform your design decisions.

Use this data to inform decision-making regarding navigation improvements, content optimization, or performance enhancements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"lesson-2-prioritize-content--and-the-tools-that-support-it\"\u003eLesson 2. Prioritize content — and the tools that support it.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent is the reason your users are on your website — it either helps them find what they need, or it helps them get something done. We developed a comprehensive \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-content/\"\u003econtent strategy\u003c/a\u003e that focused on delivering valuable and relevant information to users, and that meant removing the content that could distract from that important goal. The Clean Slate approach aimed to start fresh by evaluating each piece of content based on its relevance, usefulness, and user demand. Our strategy included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreamlining content by removing outdated or duplicate material\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAuditing content for accuracy and readability\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeveloping an internal dashboard to aid our health communicators and subject matter experts in content evaluation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating content that serves the public sometimes requires us to make resources available quickly. To that end, we also launched a new content management system to simplify editing and publishing content for our health communicators. It provides a built-in framework for content best practices and \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/search-engine-optimization/\"\u003eoptimization for search engines\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/mobile/\"\u003emobile\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/accessibility/\"\u003eaccessibility\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis system is structured to help us maintain our lean footprint. It empowers our more than 1,700 health communicators to create user-centered and consistent content. It also frees up our web developers to focus on complex tasks and data visualization rather than minor content updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lesson-3-create-a-rubric-to-evaluate-the-most-useful-content\"\u003eLesson 3: Create a rubric to evaluate the most useful content.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur goal was to retain and then optimize only the content that was highly relevant, frequently accessed, and met the needs of our intended audiences. To do this, we evaluated content based on four factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUser demand:\u003c/strong\u003e The most frequently viewed content was kept. Content that was the least viewed was marked for archiving, but then also evaluated against other factors such as division priorities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelevance:\u003c/strong\u003e If content was outdated or no longer applicable, it was marked for archiving.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDuplication:\u003c/strong\u003e Duplicate information that was relevant and in demand was consolidated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlignment with program priorities:\u003c/strong\u003e Content that addressed program priorities was kept, reviewed, and revised as needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo kick-start the decision-making process, our team built a Project Clean Slate metrics dashboard for CDC staff. The dashboard included data on page views, referrers, and search rank. This helped our health communicators and subject matter experts understand what could easily fall into the “keep” and “retire” categories. It also allowed content owners to apply qualitative criteria and make their own final decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"box \"\u003e\n  By May 2024, roughly 65 percent of existing content on CDC.gov was reduced or removed. This allowed us to direct our time and resources toward improving the quality and accessibility of the remaining content on our site.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"lesson-4-use-open-communication-channels-to-support-change-management\"\u003eLesson 4. Use open communication channels to support change management.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognize that a website redesign can bring about significant changes for staff members involved in managing or creating content. Provide training programs, support channels, and clear guidelines to facilitate smooth transitions and ensure buy-in from internal stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"box \"\u003e\n  In addition to our communication and training efforts, we provided multiple avenues for feedback and questions. This included in-person presentations, a centralized email box, help ticket logs, and weekly consults for communicators across the agency on web strategy and technical issues.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also created several options to archive and preserve content on the site that was slated for removal. Some archived content is publicly available at \u003ca href=\"https://archive.CDC.gov\"\u003earchive.CDC.gov\u003c/a\u003e, and additional content removed from public view is still accessible internally. As a fail-safe, we also provided a temporary public snapshot of the old CDC.gov at \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240515235738/https://snapshot2024.cdc.gov/\"\u003esnapshot2024.CDC.gov\u003c/a\u003e, though this site was decommissioned at the end of 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"results-after-the-cdcgov-launch\"\u003eResults after the CDC.gov launch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new CDC.gov launched in 2024 and early returns for the site are strong. Eighty-one percent of beta user participants were satisfied and liked the new site. Recent testing with members of the general public on CDC.gov show that users feel that CDC has improved their ability to find information. They also like the look and feel, consistent page summaries, content structure, and improved navigation on desktop and mobile devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety percent of healthcare professionals consider the new site streamlined and easy to use (compared with 75 percent the previous site design), and 93 percent of healthcare providers and 84 percent of general public users understood the main messages on the new site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-next-for-the-site\"\u003eWhat is next for the site\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will continue to make improvements to CDC.gov throughout 2024 and beyond. By publishing content through our new content management system, we are incorporating standardized content structures based on user-tested content templates. We will continue to perform regular user testing and improve the site based on user feedback. User feedback will continue to shape our decisions on design, content organization, navigation, and overall user experience enhancements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-can-i-do-next\"\u003eWhat can I do next?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReview \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/content-strategy/\"\u003efeatured resources on content strategy\u003c/a\u003e to learn how planning, creating, delivering, and governing content helps agencies achieve their goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also join the Digital.gov \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/communities/web-content-managers/\"\u003eWeb Managers Community of Practice\u003c/a\u003e to connect with government web practitioners and learn more about creating, managing, and contributing to government websites and digital services.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}

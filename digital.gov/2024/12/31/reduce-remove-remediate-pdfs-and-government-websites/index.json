But the history of using PDFs to share content runs deep. And while it’s true that there are still some valid use cases for PDFs, most of what currently exists would be better delivered using HTML as a standard webpage.  After all, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-23-22, Delivering a Digital-first Public Experience, encourages us to default to HTML.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003carticle class=\"dg-ring\" aria-labelledby=\"9f1fdf50d5395bcfb0ad7417c80ad477\"\u003e\n  \u003ch2 id=\"9f1fdf50d5395bcfb0ad7417c80ad477\" class=\"dg-ring__title\"\u003eUnderstand the policy framework\u003c/h2\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/\"\u003eExplore 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act and OMB M-23-22\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital practitioners from fifteen agencies weighed in during the latest conversation on the current state of affairs. And, true to the value of community, they offered steps their organizations have taken to start chipping away at the work of reducing and remediating PDFs. We are sharing community member quotes from the discussion in this post to provide some sense of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-block \"\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-block__quotation-mark\"\u003e“\u003c/span\u003e\n      So many pdfs!

The current PDF specification is \u003ca href=\"https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000474.shtml\"\u003eISO 32000-2:2020\u003c/a\u003e, which was published in December 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePDF files are independent of the software, hardware, or operating system being used. They can include text, images, graphics, audio, video, links, buttons, form fields, and business logic. They can also be electronically signed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"balancing-competing-requirements\"\u003eBalancing competing requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many complexities surrounding PDF use on government websites. Community members asked for insights into balancing accessibility with preserving the legal integrity of government documents and public transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are two common concerns about reducing the reliance on PDFs to deliver information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreserving information:\u003c/strong\u003e Agencies may rely on PDFs to maintain the integrity of official documents, such as policies, memos, and regulatory information. These documents are often lengthy and dense and don\u0026rsquo;t easily convert to HTML.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBalancing priorities:\u003c/strong\u003e Agency web teams may lack the people, time, or money to convert or remediate hundreds or thousands of legacy PDF files in addition to other tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"choosing-the-right-format-for-your-content\"\u003eChoosing the right format for your content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people think of “content” as both the information communicated and the file the information is saved in, but these are separate concepts. The “content” is the information inside the file. The file itself, regardless of type, is the delivery format. PDFs, HTML, mobile apps, and social media posts are all formats, and most can deliver the same content. When deciding whether to publish content in one format or another, the question should be: “Who will be consuming this content, and how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, are you considering \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/accessibility/\"\u003eaccessibility\u003c/a\u003e? People with disabilities, and especially those who use assistive technologies to access content, may encounter difficulties when using PDFs. Unless a PDF file is formatted carefully and intentionally, key information and functionality may not be available to those with low vision and people using screen readers and other assistive technologies. This information can be high level like document structure or details within the content itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, is your format appropriate for \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/mobile/\"\u003emobile devices\u003c/a\u003e? More than 50 percent of users access government resources from their phones, according to \u003ca href=\"http://analytics.usa.gov\"\u003eanalytics.usa.gov\u003c/a\u003e. PDFs can be difficult to read and interact with on a phone.  It’s important to optimize content for different devices. Check your web analytics to see how people access your content, and prioritize formats that will work well for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, are you \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/search-engine-optimization/\"\u003eoptimizing for search engines\u003c/a\u003e? PDFs and other static files may be demoted by ranking algorithms for usability reasons. Make sure that the information you want people to find through search is offered in HTML format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"creating-documents-with-accessibility-in-mind\"\u003eCreating documents with accessibility in mind\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-block \"\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-block__quotation-mark\"\u003e“\u003c/span\u003e\n      You can make many PDFs accessible, but it’s a big pain to do so, very time consuming (or expensive if you outsource), and still doesn’t help mobile users.\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-block__quotation-mark\"\u003e”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteer stakeholders and content creators away from PDFs and towards HTML for new content. The best way to stop needing to remediate PDFs for accessibility is to establish firm governance to prevent publication of more PDFs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to updating your \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-digital-governance/\"\u003egovernance\u003c/a\u003e, it’s also a best practice to create accessible content and remediate any remaining PDFs. Focus on core principles that ensure content is well-organized with logical navigation, regardless of the file type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some best practices for content delivery:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStructure:\u003c/strong\u003e Use uniform and hierarchical headings to structure the document. They provide a clear path for people using assistive technologies, allowing them to easily navigate content and jump directly to specific sections.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimplicity:\u003c/strong\u003e Use the simplest table configuration possible, and only use tables when needed. Tables need header cells and data cells to enable screen readers to reference the associated header cells, so the reader and listener don’t lose context.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContext:\u003c/strong\u003e Use link text that describes the destination of the link. It should make sense out of context. Screen readers read each link out loud, in sequential order, so meaningful link text lets the person know what the linked web page may be about. This includes adding alternative text descriptions, or “alt text,” on all images. Write descriptions as if you were talking with someone on the phone.

Additionally, ensure proper contrast and generous text sizing so that no information is \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/resources/an-advanced-approach-to-accessibility/\"\u003edifficult to perceive\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRedirects:\u003c/strong\u003e Once a PDF has been removed from the site, you can add a redirect on the file’s old URL to take users to the right place if they have followed a stale link.

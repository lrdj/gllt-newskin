The public shouldn’t have to guess whether the site they’re on or the email that hits their inbox is genuine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA domain uniquely identifies areas on the internet, like websites or email services. For example, \u003ccode\u003eDigital.gov\u003c/code\u003e is a domain, consisting of 1) the second-level domain \u003ccode\u003edigital\u003c/code\u003e, and 2) the top-level domain \u003ccode\u003e.gov\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/domain-management/\"\u003eDomain management\u003c/a\u003e is the process of overseeing and maintaining a domain or related domains so that they are consistent and safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomain management and web hosting are often confused for one another. However, domain management is different from web hosting in the same way that a house is different from the street address that leads to it. A domain can be a name and a location. For example, Digital.gov. is the name of an organization, but the Digital.gov domain also serves as our web address on the internet. Web hosting, by contrast, happens only behind the scenes; as an online service, a web host provides the physical (\u0026ldquo;dedicated\u0026rdquo;) and/or virtual servers needed to publish a discoverable website on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-is-domain-management-important\"\u003eWhy is domain management important?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to make sure that domains are chosen and maintained well. Your domain name is one of the first lines of trust when it comes to interacting with your agency. If people navigating the internet can match the name of your domain with the name of your agency in such a way that the user can understand that they have found the correct place, that’s one step in \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/trust/\"\u003eestablishing trust\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaging domains is also key for \u003ca href=\"https://digital.gov/topics/security/\"\u003esecurity\u003c/a\u003e. People with malicious intent can register domain names that are similar to agency sites, and, as a result, can trick people into giving away their personal information, and more. For example, malicious actors have sought to \u003ca href=\"https://get.gov/domains/election-offices/\"\u003eimpersonate election organizations\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you use a \u003ccode\u003e.gov\u003c/code\u003e TLD, it increases security because the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\"\u003eCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u003c/a\u003e (CISA) manages the .gov top-level domain and authenticates the identity of each account.

You should also be monitoring your domain name to protect against similar but fraudulent domains.

It can be tempting to add new domains for new projects, but keep in mind that more domains means more risk—and more to manage as your agency grows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-can-i-do-next\"\u003eWhat can I do next?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomain management is about more than just DNS. It’s also about ensuring a safe experience for your organization and your users. CISA provides several \u003ca href=\"https://get.gov/domains/security/\"\u003edomain security best practices\u003c/a\u003e, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdd a security contact\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelop a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, having a security contact for .gov domains makes it easier for the public to tell you of a potential security issue with your online services.

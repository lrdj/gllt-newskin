      <description>Over 67 million people in the United States have a disability, constituting the largest diversity group in the country. Despite decades of advocacy and struggle, people with disabilities continue to experience significant gaps in health and well-being, educational attainment, employment, and wealth compared to people without disabilities. These gaps have been termed the “disability divide.” The purpose of this year’s National Disability Employment Awareness campaign at the National Institutes of Health is to educate staff regarding the divide and to celebrate those who help close the disability divide by advocating for people with disabilities.</description>

There are very few technology choices we actually make at the project level, so, more often than not, we combine a limited set of technologies to make our applications. To explain this, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the metaphor of a sandwich shop.</description>

In this memo, the Archivist emphasizes that in order to have a successful transition, it is crucial that agency heads work with their Senior Agency Official for Records Management and Agency Records Officers to ensure that this message is communicated within the agency and that all agency officials and employees are properly briefed on their records management responsibilities. Review the resources posted on their website for additional information about federal records management during transition.</description>

      <description>Use the frameworks in this section to analyze the design(s) that the team has decided to forward, and to test different expressions of their parts. Through the earlier processes of divergent/convergent thinking, the shape of your design creation has emerged. Break that shape down into its component parts to determine how to start the making process.&#xA;To break down your design, examine it analytically to understand if it is simple, complicated or complex.</description>

      <description>At this point, you’ve analyzed your project through convergent and divergent thinking, generated multiple design ideas, built those out with references, and discussed them and figured out what to forward. Now take a moment to reach out to your stakeholders to communicate all this progress.&#xA;Use this critical moment to bring stakeholders up to speed on what you’ve done. This will help you avoid missing key points of view, give you an opportunity to start socializing your design, and clear the way for a rational, evidence-based assessment approach whose results will be accepted across the organization.</description>

      <description>In this guide, we refer to the project’s conceptual constraints as the project frame (scope), and the operations and logistical constraints as the project scale.&#xA;These questions can help you explain the difference:&#xA;Problem frame (scope) answers what and why&#xA;What are you studying? Why? What is your reasoning for this study? Problem scale answers how and where&#xA;How will you study your problem? Where will you execute that study? This guide uses four elements to help you determine project scale: number of teammates, number and type of stakeholders, number of locations, and number and type of deliverables required by the project.</description>

      <guid>https://digital.gov/guides/hcd/design-concepts/envisioning-ideas/</guid>
      <description>The design phase is all about creation. To aid idea expression and development, designers use non-verbal and non-text-based communication to show their ideas and thoughts, in addition to talking and/or writing about them. We use these because it can be difficult to express the fullness of ideas verbally or in text, especially collaboratively, when the idea is still emerging, vague, or unfinished.&#xA;Alternatives to verbal and text-based communication channels, like drawing, collaging, or model-making, aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily better than verbal- and text-based communications; they’re all different from one another and can be used in unison.</description>

      <description>Feedback is an integral part of the design process and should be sought out when designing anything, be it a product, service, or system. Your work will only get better In design, feedback is a multi-step phase during which the design gradually reaches farther and farther outward from the core team to gather feedback from an increasingly large pool of feedback providers.&#xA;It’s preferable to gather feedback on several of the team’s design iterations.</description>

      <description>Goals Find root causes Finding the root causes of attitudes, feelings, or behaviors are some of the key insights we drive towards in HCD discovery. If your research has been directionalized to understand why something is the way it is, then it will be easier to discover the root cause, or the reason why, during this synthesis phase.&#xA;Collaborate Synthesis is a collaborative process with your whole team. It’s not brainstorming, but can look and feel similar.</description>

      <description>Purpose The HCD Guides are intended to enhance the understanding and practice of human-centered design throughout the federal government. The Guides can be used both as teaching tools and references. They were originally created for the Veterans Administration’s (VA) Veterans Experience Office (VEO) by Insight &amp;amp; Design, a team within VEO that has expertise in human-centered design, and later adapted for use across other agencies through a partnership between GSA’s Office of Customer Experience and The Lab at OPM.</description>

      <description>The guiding principles of human-centered design include:&#xA;Empathy No wrong ideas Yes, and Collaboration Inclusion Innovation Iteration When engaging in HCD research:&#xA;Listen deeply for what people say they want and need, and how they may be creating workarounds to meet their needs. Listen for the root causes that inform the attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs of the people you’re interviewing. Be aware of your own internal biases or judgments. Fail early; fail fast; fail small.</description>

      <description>Everyone iterates at different points Iteration refers to making a series of design versions. This is a classic design practice; its purpose is to push designers past the first expression of ideas to build them out, identify their advantages and drawbacks, and revise ideas before prototyping begins.&#xA;An illustration of the iterative process. Every iteration is related to each other and either directly builds on the previous round or contradicts or changes previous iteration(s), acting as a comparison or contrast to other iterations.</description>

      <description>The methods you should use to express your design concept depends on the type of concept you choose. Look back at your references: what is the nature of the expression you&amp;rsquo;re creating, based on that collection of references? Is it a product? A service? A system? Or is it more complex than that, like a large service that needs multiple products to support it? If you&amp;rsquo;re unsure, review the designed things section of the Design Concepts Guide, where you&amp;rsquo;ll find explanations of the nature of products, services, and systems.</description>

      <description>Screening candidates To discern whether an individual is a match for your research, have a short conversation and ask them to tell you their story. Use open-ended questions like, “Can you tell me about a time when…” or “Tell me about a day in the life of your agency.” Questions like this can help you get directly into the touchpoints or pain points you may want to study, and ensure that you identify participants whose experience is pertinent to your work.</description>

      <description>Setting up for a good observation Observations present an opportunity for first-hand understanding of your participants’ experience. Observations, like interviews, have many styles, but a good place to start is to choose one of two broad approaches: fly-on-the-wall or participatory observation.&#xA;Fly-on-the-wall observations mean that the researcher stays silent while the participant accomplishes the task(s) that are pertinent to your project. Take notes and, if possible, pictures, while they accomplish their work, so that you can understand the ins and outs of the system(s) in which they interact.</description>

      <description>“How long will this take?” has to be one of the most terrifying questions any designer will be asked when embarking on the design phase. The simple answer: one can’t know — but rational time constraints can be useful. What we do know, from years of experience and many design case studies, is that getting to a simple, easy-to-understand, and useful solution to any design problem is the result of many rounds of iteration, problem-solving, and testing.</description>

      <description>The myth of a solitary genius solving a huge problem no one else could solve is just that — a myth. Although CEOs, sports team leaders, and award-winners tend to get public credit, none of those people achieve their goals without the consistent, robust support of a variety of other people.&#xA;Making decisions The same holds true in design. Although design clusters around a few big names, like Frank Gehry, an architect, Jonathon Ive, an industrial designer at Apple, and Miuccia Prada, a fashion designer, all of these people have teams with whom they work, and none of them designs in a vacuum.</description>

      <description>The design process strives to include all possible participants and stakeholders in the discovery phase. The thinking is that, if teams talk to all the people who work with a product, service, or system (participants), as well as all those who administer, approve, or oversee it (stakeholders), and design with them, then the end result of the work serves the needs of all those people.&#xA;Consider changes in workflow As they move through the design phase, teams need to evaluate how the proposed solution might change the workflow, or unduly increase the workload for participants or stakeholders.</description>

      <description>Design in the public sector can seem a slower, more complicated affair than its private sector counterpart. However, each sector has its own unique values and pressures, terms to fulfill, and spaces to explore. While the private sector is pressured by a constant need for increasing profit and the short-term thinking that such a challenge requires, the public sector must respond to and support the public through long life spans, which means nurturing ideas that support planning ahead for decades of growth and change.</description>

      <description>The design phase requires energy and effort to reach the goal of usable products, services, and systems. While teams may think they must make all the right decisions or get everything perfect before launch, it’s important to remember that no design is permanent; everything will need to change and flex, and will ultimately be succeeded by something that is hopefully more useful and more delightful than the thing originally designed.</description>

      <description>To set expectations on what they’ll accomplish together, design teams must create project-level principles at the outset of the design phase. These principles act as the team’s compass throughout a project’s development. They are tactical, immediate, and reflect an organization’s strategy and mission, perhaps articulated through a set of global design principles, but in a focused and outcome-oriented way. Design principles help set project intentions, aligning everyone to a shared project direction.</description>

      <description>Products are defined by economists as made, or manufactured, objects, typically created in a factory setting. They tend to be single-instance interactions between buyer and seller. If you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee every day, each purchase of that coffee is a new event; the coffee is the product, and the product is new every time you buy it.&#xA;Economists as a group broadly define products quite literally as something you “can drop on your foot.</description>

      <description>Through design and testing rounds, you’ve developed a strong prototype on an individual participant level; participants understand the concept, and the concept’s design solves their problem. But, as we launch our designs into a complex world, they not only have to work for the individuals who need them, but they also have to work with the products, services, and systems that will host, lead into, lead out of, support, and wrap around your product, service or system.</description>

      <description>According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured, and typically delivered on-demand. They tend to be ongoing, or things you return to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products. Going back to our coffee shop example, the touchpoints of the transaction, such as the culture and community of a coffee shop, are components of the shop’s service, which is ongoing and intangible. While the coffee you drink is a new product every day, the coffee shop provides the ongoing service of stocking, making, and selling coffee.</description>

      <description>Economists divide economies into two categories of activity: manufacturing products, and executing services. This parsing is not quite precise enough for the challenges of design, however. In the design process, we have a third possible category of designed thing: systems.&#xA;The public sector is primarily a service provider, and those services are upheld, augmented, and accessed through products. But, especially internally, the public sector also launches and maintains systems that, while not exactly services themselves, are also not exactly products.</description>

      <description>The number of testing and iteration rounds are highly specific to the nature of your project. An easy way to think about this is to compare the test results to your principles and use cases.&#xA;At the end of each round of making and testing, reflect back on this combination of goals and use cases to evaluate what to do next. For example, maybe you think you’ve accomplished your principle with the prototype form, but participants stumbled over the order in which they should fill in the information fields.</description>

      <description>“ What people say, and what people do, and what people say they do, are entirely different things. ”— Dr. Margaret Mead, Anthropologist This famous quote by Dr. Margaret Mead is a central truth to the social sciences and processes that build on them. Human-centered design is grounded in empathy and understanding. It begins with observation and research. We hear from people in their own words, to gain an understanding of what they want, expect, and need from a system, product, or experience.</description>

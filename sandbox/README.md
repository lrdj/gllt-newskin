Sandbox

This directory contains one-off experiments. The `claritylab` subfolder is a self-contained static page built from claritylab.uk content, styled with adelebrydges.com assets.

Contents to be generated:
- `claritylab/index.html` – assembled page
- `claritylab/assets/` – downloaded images
- `adele/` – downloaded CSS and supporting assets from adelebrydges.com

Note: These files are for local sandboxing only. Ensure you have permission to use external content/assets before publishing.
